                        Good quality to hear and take note of the requeriments to some project or task, questioning everything to close the space created by ambiguity.
                        I always say less is more at this case, less code is more than a big code that resolve the same, in that order of ideas, i always try to use patterns and
                        code conventions to create a solid solution.I love work with collegues bec

                        I think of myself as a complete software developer because i can work in front end as back end not matter the language, i could teach myself the
                        language that can be use to solve some problem and use it with the same conventions. Ofcourse a have experiences in several languages as you can see on the sidebar
                        but it is only a tool like others.

                        I love work with collegues because almost all me life-time as freelance i was alone.
                        when a i started with picallex the experience with them was very
                        exciting for me. I learned how their people organize to work on same project
                        using agile methologies and tools for do it remotely.
                        The situation of not know how much level the other developers
                        have as professional. Constantly force me to study-hard and improve me abilities as
                        software developer and i enjoy it so much.

                    several languages, frameworks and methodoligies. Roughly in the middle of 2015 i created a company with a couple of enginner friends called Coviper,
                    i was as mobile and web developer there and started me first projects. after that the partners break up the company and each one take his own way.
                    after disolve coviper i started me way as freelance until 2020 where i started to work from Colombia for Picallex Holding Group a company base on Argentina,
                    as front end developer but using others skills to create new projects, start the app mobile for the company and other projects to them. until date i work there.
