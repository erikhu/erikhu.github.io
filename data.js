I always try to see the news about the open-source community and big companies in general related to tech. I learn as an autodidact, self-study is my way to learn everything, I prefer to read technical books. Always I am reading some book related to software architecture, language, or just new proposals related to software. My native language is Spanish, but I have conversational English. I am open for learn some new human or computer languages too. Another thing that I enjoy is being close with many kinds of people, having good vibes, and sharing ideas, knowledge, or just a normal chat. If you would like, we can take a little talk about software at any time just tell me with some time, I enjoy that kind of conversation.",
